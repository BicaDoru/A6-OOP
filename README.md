# A6-OOP

You are very passionate about programing (otherwise you wouldn't be reading this) and C++ is a language close to your heart. On your way to becoming a guru, you study a lot and watch many tutorials. To make sure you do not miss any good tutorials, you absolutely need a software application to help you manage your tutorials and create watch lists. The application can be used in two modes: administrator and user. When the application is started, it will offer the option to choose the mode.
Administrator mode: The application will have a database , which holds all the tutorials. You must be able to update_admin the database, meaning: add_admin a new tutorial, delete a tutorial and update_admin the information of a tutorial. Each Tutorial has a title, a presenter (name of the presenter person), a duration (minutes and seconds), a number of likes and a link towards the online resource containing the tutorial. The administrators will also have the option to see all the tutorials in the database.
User mode: A user can create a watch list with the tutorials that he/she wants to watch
+ many more stuff
